# Core Concepts and Modules

The `primetunnel` library is structured around several key modules, each responsible for a critical aspect of establishing and maintaining nonlocal communication via Prime Resonance.

## `src/core.js`: The Resonance Engine

The `core.js` module is the heart of the `primetunnel` library. It encapsulates the fundamental algorithms for generating and managing the prime resonance patterns. This module is responsible for:

*   **Prime Sequence Generation**: Generating sequences of prime numbers that serve as the basis for resonant frequencies.
*   **Resonance Pattern Synthesis**: Synthesizing complex vibrational patterns from these prime sequences, ensuring their unique resonant properties.
*   **Attunement Calibration**: Providing methods for precise calibration and synchronization between communicating entities to achieve perfect resonance.

## `src/pulsar-frequencies.js`: The Signal Modulator

This module handles the transformation of raw data into "pulsar frequencies" â€“ the specific prime-derived vibrational patterns that carry information across the prime tunnel. `pulsar-frequencies.js` is concerned with:

*   **Data-to-Frequency Encoding**: Converting arbitrary data streams into modulated prime frequencies. This involves mapping data bits or chunks to specific variations or shifts in the resonant pattern.
*   **Frequency Stability Management**: Ensuring the stability and integrity of the generated frequencies, crucial for maintaining the nonlocal link.

## `src/nonlocal-comms.js`: The Communication Interface

The `nonlocal-comms.js` module provides the high-level interface for initiating and managing nonlocal communication sessions. It orchestrates the interactions between the `core.js` and `pulsar-frequencies.js` modules. Its responsibilities include:

*   **Session Establishment**: Initiating a nonlocal communication session by establishing a resonant link with a target entity.
*   **Data Exchange Protocols**: Managing the flow of data across the prime tunnel, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery.
*   **Error Detection and Correction**: Implementing mechanisms to detect and correct any deviations in resonance that might affect data integrity.

## `src/prime-resonance.js`: The Theoretical Foundation

While not directly involved in the operational aspects of communication, `prime-resonance.js` serves as a foundational module, encapsulating the theoretical underpinnings and mathematical models of Prime Resonance. It provides:

*   **Prime Number Theory Integration**: Incorporating advanced prime number theory to inform the generation and manipulation of resonant frequencies.
*   **Resonance Model Definition**: Defining the mathematical models that describe the behavior and properties of prime resonance.

## `src/config.js`: Configuration and Parameters

This module centralizes all configurable parameters and settings for the `primetunnel` library. It allows for fine-tuning various aspects of the resonance engine and communication protocols, such as:

*   **Resonance Depth**: Adjusting the complexity and depth of prime sequences used for resonance.
*   **Frequency Bandwidth**: Defining the range of frequencies utilized for communication.
*   **Security Parameters**: Setting parameters related to the dynamic nature of the prime tunnel for enhanced security.

These modules work in concert to provide a robust and functional framework for demonstrating and utilizing true nonlocal communication through Prime Resonance.
